# iCAD Update Notes (Nov-2024)


**Hello, and welcome again,** 

We are excited to bring more functions and features to our users. This release includes major and minor enhancements to the iCAD product suite - mainly Data Processing tools, Diversion Weir Design and TeraForm modules.

Learn about the update features and functions included in this release below.




## Table of Contents

Key in this release include new modules for diversion weir design and embankment works analysis.

## What's New

### Data Processing
[Back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

Data processing tools are enhanced for the following capabilities.

1. Ability to generate minor tick marks, allowing better flexibilty for subssequent tasks such as offseting.

2. Allow direct plot of data in situations where referenced object is not ready or not available. This is facilitated by the provision of additional options in the plot dialog.

### Diversion Weir Design
[Back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

The following enhancements are made to the module:

1. Sub-surface data consideration capability to generate BoQ. This feature contributes to significant reduction of workload, as well as accuracy in estimation of BoQ with the proper subsurface strata information.

    The BoQ extracted using this feature looks similar to the one shown below.

    Note: Strate informraiton is a speciality service we offer until the product obtains partnership for testing and validation, subsurface information analysis and presentation being a complex and highly expert guided task. The following figure shows a snapshot of the module.

1. Improved startup algorithm to show tentative (auto) designs with recommeneded values per default design criteria. The module now shows multiple design guides to aid the engineers judgement.

    The figure shows design guide values for:
    a. Limiting overflow depth for broad crested weir flow assumptions to hold true.
    b. Lacey's scour depth estimates for the current design discharge and weir length, and bed material.
    c. Recomended apron length for the specified energy desipator mechanism, determined based on the length of the prevalent hydraulic jump.
    d. Minimum depth of downstream cutoff wall, that must be maintained to meet exit gradient criteria.



### TeraForm
[Back to ToC](#table-of-contents)

1. Improved precision of zone material definition, resulting in accurate area (and hence BoQ) estimates. A new dialog is included to identify casuses of error, and address them.

    The below figure shows the accuracy achieved with out and with the refined layers.

1. Allow editing of assembly data with interface, removing previous constraint that required users to delete assembly and redefine.

     <img src="./media/Image 009.png">

     The enhancement allows full edit functionality to user defined or AutoCAD picked sources.

1. Corrected cross-section display view on main interface. Previously crossing zones are now corrected, and the drawings can be exported to AutoCAD directly.
